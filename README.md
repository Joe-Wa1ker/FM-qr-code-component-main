## My process

I started out by writing out what my approach would be, on paper: 

- Outline of HTML (accurate).
- Outline of CSS - included media queries which I didn't use in the end. 
- Began coding but encountered issues where the card and it's content were not being displayed correctly, so I sought help on Discord. Responses on Discord basically outlined that I was over-engineering it and needed to remove a lot of what I had done, and that I needed to make better use of MAX-width, rather than width. This made the solution more scalable.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS, flexbox

### What I learned

- Keep it as simple as possibe - code is better when it is minimal and the way I was approaching the project meant that I was negating the default flexbility/responsiveness of browsers. Browsers start out flexible.
- Setting max-width/heights stops code being too prescriptive and allows elements to scale as needed across different devices.
- Using a CSS reset is common and best practise, I need to find one that works for me and start implementing it.
